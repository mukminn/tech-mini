# Contributing via this repository

This repo contains helper scripts, templates, and tracking issues to help you contribute to Aerodrome Finance and other Base ecosystem projects.

Steps to contribute:
1. Run the clone script to fetch Aerodrome repositories:
   ```bash
   ./clone-aerodrome.sh
   ```
2. Use the included `scripts/find-aerodrome-good-first-issues.sh` (requires GitHub CLI `gh`) to list beginner-friendly issues.
3. Fork the target repository on GitHub and create a branch for your fix.
4. Make changes, run tests locally (see target repo README), and open a PR from your fork.
5. Add the PR link and commit hashes to the meta-issue `Track and Plan Contributions to Base Ecosystem and Crypto/Web3 Projects` in this repo for tracking.

If you want me (Copilot) to perform steps (find issues / propose small docs fixes / open PR drafts), grant permission and I will create branches and PRs in the target repos using a fork-and-PR workflow (or push to a branch in this repo if you allow writing).
